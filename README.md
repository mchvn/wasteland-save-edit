# wasteland-save-edit

## What is this?

This is a simple tool to decompress Wasteland 3 save files, edit them, and save them.

## What are the goals of this project?

This project was created to address the lack of an accessible tool to edit Wasteland 3 saves. Current tools either require you to download an executable and run it on your computer and are Windows-only, or require you to have some programming knowledge to run the decompression yourself. 

This tool will run online, and this will require no download and be cross-platform.

In addition, this project was designed to be as simple as possible, so the decompression (and recompression) is done all in-browser without the need for a true backend infrastructure.

## What stage is this project in?

This project is in MVP form-- it has all the basic functionality to work as intended, but with many more features to come.

## What is this project built in?

This project is built in React with JS.
